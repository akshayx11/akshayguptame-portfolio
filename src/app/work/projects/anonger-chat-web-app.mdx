**Auto-Disposable Chat Application**  
This open-source chat application is designed for simplicity and privacy. Built using Node.js, it provides users with a seamless chat experience where no signup or login is necessary. Users simply enter their name and a private room name to begin chatting with friends. The core feature of this app is its auto-disposable nature: once you close or refresh the app, all conversations and shared media are permanently erased.  

## My Role and Contributions  
As the creator of this project, I developed a simple and user-friendly chat interface with a focus on anonymity and disposable conversations.  

### Key Features  
- **No Login Required**: Users can directly join a chat by entering their name and a private room name.  
- **Disposable Conversations**: All chat data is destroyed upon closing or refreshing the app, ensuring privacy.  
- **Easy Setup**: Users can join the chat by visiting [anon.akshaygupta.me](http://anon.akshaygupta.me), choosing a room, and clicking "START NOW."  
- **Privacy-Focused**: After chatting, closing the window removes all shared messages and media, leaving no trace.  

This project was developed to provide a simple, secure, and private chat environment, giving users a platform for real-time conversations without concerns about data retention.
